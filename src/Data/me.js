    I am an adept Web Developer and find myself crawling towards
    the beauties and aesthetics of the web. I also work extensively
    with iOS using swift. I feel like it's every consumer's necessity
    to experience quality products, with a robust feature-set whilst
    enjoying a hassle-free User experience. I strive to make that possible
    in every product I develop/design.`,

    a UI/UX designer. I work extensively with ReactJS and Swift/SwiftUI and aspire
    to create simple and good looking User Interfaces. I give equal importance to
    stylesheets and behavior, because I believe, together, they can spark magic. I've
    also had my share of backend experience with python (flask) and SQLAlchemy with a
    few full stack projects. I have a keen eye of layouts and colors and do my best to
    contribute to robust and good looking interfaces. And oh, I love Apple ï£¿`,
